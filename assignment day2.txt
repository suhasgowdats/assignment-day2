1. List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs

->Nodejs

*   Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
*   “location” object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.
*    Ofcourse Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.
*   Node has “global”, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
*   “require” object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.

->Browser JS(console)
*   “window” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
*   “location” is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.
*   “document”, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.
*   Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”.
*   Browsers don’t have “require” predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
*   Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers.
